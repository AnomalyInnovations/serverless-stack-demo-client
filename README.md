# Serverless Stack Demo React App [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1673e9d8-8b4b-4d02-a6d0-e805921f3209/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/serverless-stack-demo-client/deploys)

The [Serverless Stack Guide](http://serverless-stack.com) is a free comprehensive resource to creating full-stack serverless applications. We create a [note taking app](http://demo2.serverless-stack.com) from scratch.

The main part of the guide uses [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack). We also have an alternative version that uses Serverless Framework. This repo connects to the [Serverless Framework version of the backend](https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-api).
